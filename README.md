**Dashboard Description**: E-Commerce Sales Performance

This dashboard, titled "BUSINESS SALES DASHBOARD FROM E-COMMERCE DATA," provides a comprehensive overview of key sales metrics and performance trends. It's designed to give a quick, clear look at the business's health by breaking down sales data across different dimensions.     

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**     

At the top, four large cards highlight the most critical numbers:

Sum of Sales: The total sales amount, which is 1122.

Sum of Profit: The total profit generated, which is 624.

Sum of Quantity: The total number of items sold, which is 11.

Sum of Cost: The total cost of goods sold, which is 498.

These KPIs offer a high-level summary of the business's overall performance.

**Detailed Analysis:**             

The dashboard also includes several charts and tables that provide a deeper dive into the data:

Sales by Sub-Category: A horizontal bar chart shows which product sub-categories are driving the most sales. Bookcases and Chairs appear to be top performers, with sales well over 100k, while Copiers and Appliances have lower sales figures.

Sales and Profit by Sub-Category: A line chart visually compares the sales and profit for different sub-categories. This helps identify products that might have high sales but low profit margins, or vice versa.

Sales by Region: A pie chart breaks down total sales by Region (Central, North, South). This allows users to quickly see which regions are most profitable. Based on the chart, the Central region appears to be the largest contributor to sales.

Sales by Customer: A table lists detailed transaction information, including Customer Name, Order ID, Segment, Quantity, Category, and Sum of Sales. This view is excellent for a granular analysis of individual customer purchases and their contributions to total sales.
